Introduction
============

The aim of Noter is to create a simple text editor for taking notes. It should have a range of appropriate affordances that support this task.

User interface:
  * purely keyboard driven
  * text, gui or web interfaces
  * fast, incremental search with ranked results
  * modeless maybe
  * follow the principle of instant-declaration once I work out what that is.
